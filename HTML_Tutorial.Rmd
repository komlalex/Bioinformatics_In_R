This is a tutorial on how to use rmarkdown for reproducible research

Here we an type long passages or descriptions for our data without the need of "hashing" out our comments with the # symbol. In our first example, we will be using the ToothGrowth dataset. In this experiment, Guinea Pigs (literal) were given different amounts of Vitamin C to see the effect on the growth rate of the animal's teeth.

To run R code in a markdown file, we need to denogte the section that is considered R code. We call these "code chunks"

Below is a code chunk

```{r}
ToothData <- ToothGrowth
